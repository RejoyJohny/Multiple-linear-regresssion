# Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This project utilizes multiple linear regression to predict city fuel efficiency (MPG) based on various vehicle attributes. The dataset used contains information on vehicle dimensions, engine specifications, driveline, fuel type, and other key features.

## Features
- Reads a CSV dataset containing car specifications.
- Computes vehicle volume from height, length, and width.
- Performs one-hot encoding on categorical variables.
- Splits data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluates model performance using R² score and RMSE.
- Visualizes regression predictions with a scatter plot and regression line.



## Model Performance Metrics
- **R² Score:** Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance in fuel efficiency.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures the average error between predicted and actual values.

## Visualization
A scatter plot is generated showing actual vs. predicted city MPG with a regression line to illustrate model accuracy.
